# Singly Linked List Implementation

This is a Python implementation of a **Singly Linked List**. A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next element in the sequence. This implementation includes various operations such as adding, removing, and searching elements, as well as other utilities like reversing the list and detecting loops.

## Features

- **Add Elements:**
  - Add elements to the beginning (`addFirst`)
  - Add elements to the end (`append` / `addLast`)
  - Add elements after a specified index (`addAfterNode`)
  
- **Remove Elements:**
  - Remove the first element (`removeFirstNode`)
  - Remove the last element (`removeLastNode`)
  - Remove by value (`removeData`)
  - Remove by index (`removeNodeIndex`)
  
- **Search:**
  - Linear search for elements (`lSearch`)
  - Binary search for elements in a sorted list (`bSearch`)
  - Get index of a specific element (`index_of`)

- **Other Utilities:**
  - Swap two nodes (`swapNode`)
  - Sort the list (`lSort`)
  - Reverse the list (`reverse`)
  - Detect loops (`detectLoop`)
  - Copy the list (`copy`)
  - Merge two linked lists (`merge`)
  - Find the middle element (`middleNode`)
  - Traverse through the list (`traverse`)
  - Iteration support (`__iter__` and `__next__`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
